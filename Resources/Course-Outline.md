# Object-Oriented Programming Course

## Course Title
Object-Oriented Programming

## Course Code
-

## Prerequisites
- Introduction to Programming
- Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) using a modern programming language. Students will learn to design, implement, and test software systems using OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The course also covers advanced topics like design patterns, exception handling, and file I/O.


## Course Objectives:
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1. Understand and apply the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
2. Design, implement, and test object-oriented software solutions to real-world problems.
3. Utilize key object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in software development.
4. Use advanced OOP features like interfaces, abstract classes, and exception handling.
5. Develop the ability to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, reusable components.
6. Demonstrate proficiency in a modern programming language (e.g., Java, Python, or C++) that supports OOP.
7. Understand and apply design patterns in software development.
