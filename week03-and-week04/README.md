# Assignment: Understanding Core OOP Principles

**Objective:**  
This assignment is designed to help you deeply understand and apply the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€” Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. You will be expected to demonstrate your understanding through both theoretical explanations and practical implementation, using real-world scenarios. **Please note that all practical implementation should be done in Python.**

## Part 1: Theoretical Questions

### 1. Encapsulation and Data Hiding
- Define encapsulation in your own words and explain why it is an important concept in OOP.
- Discuss the role of access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) in implementing encapsulation.
- Provide an example of how encapsulation can prevent unauthorized access to the internal state of an object.
- Explain the importance of getters and setters in encapsulation. When should you use them?

### 2. Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Define inheritance and explain the difference between base (super) and derived (sub) classes.
- Discuss method overriding and its significance in OOP.
- Explain polymorphism and how it relates to dynamic method dispatch.
- Provide a real-world example where inheritance and polymorphism are utilized effectively.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

**All practical implementation must be done in Python.**

### Task 1: Implementing Encapsulation
Imagine you are building an application for managing employee records within a company. Implement a class in Python that encapsulates employee details such as name, ID, and salary. The class should have:
- Private variables to store the employee's details.
- Public getters and setters to access and update these details, ensuring that the salary cannot be set to a negative value.
- Provide a brief explanation of your code and how encapsulation is implemented to protect the data.

### Task 2: Implementing Inheritance and Polymorphism
You are tasked with creating a simple simulation for a vehicle management system where different types of vehicles (e.g., Cars, Trucks) are managed. Implement the following in Python:
- A base class `Vehicle` with common attributes like `make`, `model`, and a method `start_engine`.
- Derived classes `Car` and `Truck` that override the `start_engine` method.
- Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a function that takes any vehicle object and calls its `start_engine` method.
- Provide a brief explanation of your code and how inheritance and polymorphism are implemented to handle different types of vehicles.
